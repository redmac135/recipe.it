# Client READme ðŸ‘‹

Our app's front end is build on React Native and Expo. You can either use the Expo Go app to run the applicaiton on your physical device, or you can run it on web. Both options are explained below:

## Get started

1. Make sure you have completed the back end section first, so that you can load into the app and have everything work immediately.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the 'client' folder.

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

Now, the app is up and running on the front end.

## Physical Device

Once you have started the application, a QR code should pop up in the terminal. 

1. Log in to Expo Go
2. Scan the QR Code (either through the Camera App or Expo Go itself)

After a few seconds, the app should now be loaded on your phone.


## Web

To get to the mobile app running on the Web, you can either:
1. Follow the link that says "Web is waiting on..."
2. Type 'w' in the command line.

Once in the Web, since the app is designed for phone screens:
1. Right-click and click 'Inspect' on Google Chrome.
2. In the menu that popped up (most likely to the right of the screen), at the top left of the menu, there is an icon with a computer behind a phone. Click this to enter mobile dimensions (For the most accurate dimensions of our design, use iPhone 14 Pro Max).
