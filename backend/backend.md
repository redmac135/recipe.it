# Backend READme ðŸ‘‹

Our app's back end is built on Python and calls Conductor to execute workflows. To run it, you just have to start the FastAPI server:

## Get started

1. First, you have to pass Firebase authentication by getting the service key. Thorough documentation on how to do this can be found on the following Firebase webpage:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart

2. If you have done the above steps properly, you should have a serviceAccountKey.json file in your backend folder.

3. Install the virtual environment

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Start the backend

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
